## Install

### Schemastore (not yet)

Ideally the schema of this repo would be available from the [Schemastore](https://www.schemastore.org/json/) and it would be almost zero configuration in most IDEs. But that is something the Kirby 3 CMS team should do eventually, not me.

### Manual IDE configuration

#### VSCode

You will need the [Red Hat VS Code YAML Extension](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-yaml) and then you can use the `yaml.schemas` setting to add your schema like this:

```yaml
  "yaml.schemas": {
    "/path/to/your/schema/kirby4-blueprints.schema.json": "site/blueprints/**/*.yml"
  }
```

This will automatically use the schema for all blueprint files.

The extension prepends `/` on the path so its `/~/YOUR_FOLDER/kirby3-schema/kirby4-blueprints.schema.json`.

#### PHP Storm

Clone this repo to your local machine. Open the IDE settings and search for `JSON Schema`. Then select `Languages & Frameworks` » `Schemas and DTDs` » `JSON Schema Mappings`. Click the `+` button at the top to add a new JSON validate configuration. Then fill in the corresponding name, file or URL, and version.

For testing I mapped it to my `site/blueprints` folder.

### Blueprint detection

Since Kirby reuses some types like `file`, `info`, `pages` in fields and sections the schema can not always determine which blueprint you are working on with absolute certainty. For now, I introduced a `blueprint` property to solve this. Use it in your `file`, `page`, `user` and `site` blueprints.  

```diff
+ blueprint: site

title: My Site Blueprint

fields:
  text:
    type: text
```

```diff
+ blueprint: page

title: My Page Blueprint

fields:
  text:
    type: text
```
